        "remain the same (`GrLivArea`, `GarageCars`, `YearBuilt`, `TotRmsAbvGrd`)\n",
        "and their importances are identical to the numerical `zipCode` model.\n",
        "\n",

        "In this specific scenario with a shallow tree (`max_depth=3`) and the\n",
        "given data, the encoding of `zipCode` (numerical vs. one-hot encoded\n",

        "    capture the complex relationships or small improvements in impurity\n",
        "    offered by individual zip code categories.\n",
        "-   **One-Hot Encoding Sparsity:** One-hot encoding creates many new\n",
        "    features, making the data sparse. With a limited number of splits,\n",
        "    the tree might prioritize more impactful continuous features.\n",
        "-   **Lack of Strong Individual Zip Code Effect:** It’s possible that\n",
        "    within the context of the other strong predictors like `GrLivArea`,\n",
        "    no *single* zip code dummy variable has a strong enough individual\n",
        "    predictive power to be selected for a split at this tree depth.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "While the *method* of encoding categorical variables correctly is\n",
        "crucial for model interpretability and avoiding meaningless numerical\n",
